===============================

This game is like the classic game "Frogger".

Once the files are downloaded to your machine then open up index.html in your browser.
The game will begin once the file has loaded.

Objective:
Move your player from the grass tiles over the stone tiles to the water tile.  Once your player reaches the edge
of the water then you've won and your player will reset.

Be careful because enemy bug characters move across the screen to impede your progress.  You must avoid the enemy bugs
in order to reach the water safely.  If an enemy bug runs into your player then your player will reset
to the beginning position and will lose that round.

Movement:
To move your player around the screen press the up, down, left, or right arrow keys.  Your player will move one tile
in the corresponding direction.
